# ByteCubed Code challenges

## Overview
Here you will find a series of our coding assessments.  We tend to rotate through them over the year to keep the challenges fresh and exciting.  They all follow basically the same structure.

1. Role/Skillset
2. Challenge Instructions and Definition
3. Submission Instructions

### Instructions

Most of the instructions are fairly straightforward, but here are a few tips that may help:

- Please only submit the source files and appropriate configuration, binaries will be discarded.
- Feel free to leverage Github as your source code management service and share a link to the repository with your reviewer.
- You are only required to submit one of the challenges so don't feel like you have the answer them all (there is no extra credit for doing more than one :))

## Please, please, please
Ask any questions that you may have so we can better enhance this process and help others in the future.

Thanks
