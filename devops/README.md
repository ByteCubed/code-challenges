# ByteCubed Code challenges

## Overview
These challenges center around activities commonly done when working with Configuration Management.  Each of these challenges will require infrastructure that is provisioned and accessible externally.  Our preference is to have configuration that is deployed on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com).  Each of these examples will only require the AWS free tier.
