# DevOps Code Challenges
The purpose of this page is to a set of challenges that rotate fairly frequently that candidates can select from to deliver their coding assessment.  Below you will find answer to common questions along with the high level process to follow.  

These challenges center around activities commonly done when working with Configuration Management.  Each of these challenges will require infrastructure that is provisioned and accessible externally.  Our preference is to have configuration that is deployed on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com).  Each of these examples will only require the AWS free tier.
